# Phase 3 - Transformer Contextual Validation Decisions

## Objective

- This document outlines the key design decisions for Phase 3: transformer-based validation of extracted clinical entities.
- Phase 3 builds on Phase 2, where deterministic rules generate high-recall, span-aligned candidate entities.
- The transformer layer converts these candidates into contextually valid, task-specific outputs via semantic classification.
- The goal is a scalable, reproducible, and clinically meaningful validation layer.

---

## Model Selection

### 1. Objective

- Select a model capable of sentence-level, context-aware classification of extracted entities
- Ensure compatibility with Phase 2 schema (`sentence_text`, `entity_text`)
- Balance:
  - Clinical performance  
  - Computational efficiency  
  - Scalability  
  - Reproducibility    

This serves as the formal reproducibility specification for Phase 3 model selection.

---

### 2. Design Context (From Phase 2)

Phase 2 produces:

- High-recall candidate entities:
  - `SYMPTOM`
  - `INTERVENTION`
  - `CLINICAL_CONDITION`
- Structured schema with:
  - Span (`entity_text`)
  - Context (`sentence_text`)
  - Validation placeholders (`is_valid`, `confidence`, `task`)

Input–Output Requirements:

- **Input:** `(sentence_text, entity_text)`  
- **Output:**
  - `is_valid` → binary classification  
  - `confidence` → probability score  
  - `task` → entity-specific interpretation  

The task is entity-level contextual classification, not sequence labelling or text generation

---

### 3. Nature of the Task (Critical Clarification)

The task requires contextual reasoning specific to each entity type:

| Entity Type         | Required Reasoning |
|--------------------|------------------|
| `SYMPTOM`           | Negation (present vs absent) |
| `INTERVENTION`      | Intent vs execution (planned vs performed) |
| `CLINICAL_CONDITION`| Temporality, certainty, diagnostic status |

Examples:
- “no chest pain” → symptom = **invalid (negated)**
- “plan to start antibiotics” → intervention = **invalid (not performed)**
- “history of MI” → condition = **invalid (not active)**

Key Requirement:
- Interpret meaning of entity within full sentence context
- Handle:
  - Clinical shorthand
  - Multi-clause sentences
  - Ambiguity and implicit meaning

---

### 4. Approaches Considered

#### 4.1 Model Types

| Approach                     | Strengths                              | Limitations |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| Rule-based systems          | Interpretable, deterministic           | Cannot model complex context, brittle to variation |
| Classical ML (e.g. LR, SVM) | Simple, efficient                    | Requires manual feature engineering, weak semantic understanding |
| CNNs (text classification)  | Capture local n-gram patterns          | Limited long-range context, weak for negation/temporal scope |
| RNNs / LSTMs                | Sequential modelling                   | Struggle with long-range dependencies, less efficient than transformers |
| Transformers (BERT-style)   | Full-context attention, strong semantics | Higher computational cost |

---

#### 4.2 Key Limitations of Non-Transformer Models

**1. Classical Machine Learning (e.g. Logistic Regression, SVM)**

These models rely on explicit feature engineering, typically using:
- Bag-of-words / TF-IDF representations  
- Manually engineered indicators (e.g. negation flags, keyword presence)

Limitations:
- No inherent understanding of word order or context  
- Inability to model relationships between tokens within a sentence  
- Heavy reliance on manually defined features such as:
  - Negation rules (“no”, “denies”)  
  - Temporal indicators (“history of”, “previous”)  

Implication:
- Reintroduces the same brittleness as rule-based systems  
- Poor generalisation to:
  - Unseen phrasing  
  - Clinical shorthand  
  - Complex sentence structures  


**2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs for Text)**

CNNs operate by learning local n-gram patterns through sliding convolutional filters.

Strengths:
- Effective at capturing short phrases (e.g. “chest pain”, “respiratory failure”)  
- Computationally efficient  

Limitations:
- Restricted receptive field (limited context window)  
- Weak modelling of long-range dependencies  

Failure cases:
- Negation scope: “no evidence of chest pain”  
- Multi-clause sentences: “patient denies chest pain but reports shortness of breath”  

Implication:
- Cannot reliably determine whether an entity is valid within full sentence context  


**3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs / LSTMs)**

RNN-based models process text sequentially, maintaining a hidden state across tokens.

Strengths:
- Designed for sequential data  
- Can, in theory, capture contextual flow  

Limitations:
- Difficulty capturing long-range dependencies:
  - Early tokens (e.g. negation) may not effectively influence later tokens  
- Gradient degradation over long sequences (even with LSTM/GRU variants)  
- Limited parallelisation → slower training and inference  

Failure cases:
- Long clinical sentences with multiple clauses  
- Context-dependent meaning spanning distant tokens  

Implication:
- Inconsistent performance for:
  - Negation handling  
  - Temporal reasoning  
  - Complex clinical phrasing 

---

#### 4.3 Conclusion

Across all non-transformer approaches:

- Context is either not modelled or only partially captured through manual features or local patterns
- Long range dependencies and complex sentence structures are not effectively handled
- Robust handling of negation, temporality, and intent is not achievable without extensive manual engineering

These limitations directly conflict with the requirements of Phase 3, where:

- Entity validity depends on full-sentence contextual interpretation
- Clinical meaning is often distributed across multiple tokens and clauses  

As a result, non-transformer models are not suitable for this task, motivating the selection of transformer-based architectures.

---

#### 4.3 Why Transformers Are Selected

Transformers address these limitations through:

- **Self-attention mechanism:** Directly model relationships between all tokens in a sentence  
- **Context-aware representations:** Meaning of a word depends on surrounding words (contextualized embeddings)  
- **Implicit feature engineering:** Negation, temporality, and intent are learned from data, no manual rule encoding

This is critical for distinguishing:

- **Negation:** “no chest pain” vs “chest pain”
- **Intent vs execution:** “planned intubation” vs “intubated”  
- **Temporality:** “history of stroke” vs “acute stroke”  

Transformer-based models are the minimal class of models capable of reliably performing the required contextual validation task.

### 5. Transformer Classes Considered

#### 5.1 Transformer Variants

| Model Type              | Strengths                                  | Weaknesses |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------|
| **General BERT**           | Efficient, well-supported                   | Weak clinical understanding |
| **Clinical BERT variants** | Domain-specific language understanding      | Slightly heavier |
| **Large LLMs (GPT, Gemma)**| Strong reasoning, flexible                  | Expensive, non-deterministic, poor structure control, unstable outputs |
| **Custom-trained**   | Fully tailored                             | Requires large labelled dataset |

---

#### 5.2 Encoder vs Generative Models

**Encoder Models (BERT-style):**

- Input → full sequence processed simultaneously  
- Output → fixed contextual representation → classification head  
- Designed for:
  - Classification
  - Token labelling
  - Sentence-level understanding  

Properties:
- Bidirectional context (full sentence considered at once)
- Outputs structured probabilities (e.g. logits → softmax)
- Deterministic at inference:
  - Given fixed weights and no stochastic layers (e.g. dropout disabled), the same input produces identical output
- Strong alignment with structured prediction tasks

**Generative Models (LLMs):**

- Input → sequential token generation  
- Output → generated text (token-by-token)  
- Designed for:
  - Open-ended reasoning
  - Text generation
  - Instruction following  

Properties:
- Autoregressive decoding (predict next token repeatedly)
- Output depends on:
  - Prompt phrasing  
  - Decoding strategy (temperature, top-k, top-p)  
- Inherently probabilistic:
  - Even with temperature = 0, outputs may vary due to:
    - Implementation-level nondeterminism
    - Tie-breaking between tokens
- Produces unstructured text rather than fixed schema outputs  

---

#### 5.3 Why LLMs Are Not Used

Although LLMs are powerful, they are fundamentally misaligned with the requirements of this pipeline.

1. Task mismatch
    - Required task: Binary classification (`is_valid`) with structured outputs  
    - LLM capability: Free-form text generation  

Implication:
- Requires prompt engineering to simulate classification  
- Adds unnecessary abstraction and failure modes 

2. Output instability
    - Hard to guarantee strict JSON schema
    - Requires prompt engineering + parsing

3. Scalability constraints
    - High cost for large datasets
    - Slower batch processing

4. Reproducibility concerns
    - Outputs may vary across runs or model versions

Conclusion:

- LLMs are suitable for reasoning and prototyping
- Not optimal for high-throughput, structured validation pipelines in a clinical context where consistency and interpretability are crucial.

### 6. Transformer Decision

#### 6.1 Final Model Class

Chosen approach for Phase 3:
1. Use a clinical-domain pretrained encoder model
2. Apply supervised fine-tuning for classification

Candidate models include:
- BioClinicalBERT
- PubMedBERT
- ClinicalBERT

---

#### 6.2 Why Clinical Pretrained Models

Clinical text contains:
- Abbreviations: “SOB”, “PRBC”, “NGT” 
- Domain-specific phrasing 
- Non-standard grammar and shorthand

General models:
- Misinterpret or ignore clinical shorthand and patterns

Clinical models:
- Pretrained on MIMIC notes or PubMed abstracts
- Already encode clinical terminology and ICU-style documentation patterns

Outcome:
- Stronger domain understanding from the start
- Improved accuracy in understanding and classifying clinical sentences
- Reduced need for large training datasets to learn clinical language patterns from scratch

| PubMedBERT       | Medium    | High       | Moderate   | Strong biomedical knowledge |
| ClinicalBERT     | Medium    | Moderate   | Moderate   | Older, less specialised |

---

#### 6.5 Final Model Choice

Selected: **BioClinicalBERT**

Rationale:
- Pretrained on clinical notes (closest match to ICU data)
- Strong performance on clinical NLP tasks
- Best alignment with Phase 2 data distribution

---

### 7. Final Decision Summary

  - LLMs (inefficient, unstable)

**Result:**
A robust, scalable, and clinically aligned validation layer that complements Phase 2 and enables reliable downstream analysis.
